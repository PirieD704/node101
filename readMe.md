#Node.JS practice

###This is a series of intro to node exercises to get familiarized with the basic concepts in node. We covered HTTP and the verbs associated with it (Get and Post). We stepped through the process of establishing a server with .createserver, the uses of request and response (req and res), and the process of running our javascript and html files on a localhost through node.

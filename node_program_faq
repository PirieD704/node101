A node program typically goes like this:
1. define the type of interaction and use the require method to get a var for it
2. Create the new server
3. Hand the server a function to handle any request it gets
4. The requests will send a "request" object and it will send back a "response" obj.
5. Tell the server to start listening and handling requests on a particular port.
